# 🛡️ Humanitarian Crisis Reporting App

> A secure, multilingual platform for reporting abuse and emergencies in humanitarian and crisis contexts — designed for use in refugee camps, disaster zones, and vulnerable communities.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

This open-source project was originally a safety reporting app. It has been **fully re-engineered** into a **humanitarian-grade reporting system** that can be used by NGOs, field workers, and affected individuals to report urgent issues such as:

- Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
- Child protection violations
- Health emergencies
- Displacement or shelter issues
- Food insecurity
- Security risks or violence
- Water & sanitation challenges

The platform prioritizes **anonymity, offline access, multilingual support, geolocation, and mobile-first access**, making it ideal for deployment in conflict-affected or low-infrastructure regions.
